# Handwritten Digits Recognition

This repository aimed contains a multi-layer neural network implementation to classify MNIST. As the MNIST dataset has 60,000 images which may be too large for batch gradient descent. Therefore, 6000 samples for training and 1000 samples for testing have been taken.
Number of hidden layers and neurons in each layer can be configured using command line parameters.

Parameters:
num_iterations = 500 
learning_rate  = 0.2
decay_rate     = 0.01
